    <h1>OLD BASSMENT CHURCH</h1>
    <hr/>
    <a href="index1220.html">home</a>
    <p>The Old Basement Church stands as a testament to the
         architectural and cultural heritage <br/>of its community. 
         Originally constructed in the early 19th century, 
         it served as a central <br/>gathering place for worship and
          community events. The church's basement, with its low 
          ceilings<br/> and stone walls, provided a humble but sacred 
          space for parishioners. Over the decades,<br/> this basement
           hosted countless events, from Sunday school classes to 
           community meetings,<br/> becoming an integral part of the local 
           social fabric</p>
